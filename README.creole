= libh2o-tgbot
A fast, efficient [[https://core.telegram.org/bots/api|Telegram bot]] server library based on [[https://github.com/h2o/h2o|libh2o]]

=== Plan
* Going to use webhooks as default request result handler since libh2o is good at this kind of work
* Main structures are going to be based on [[https://github.com/tucnak/telebot|Golang Telebot framework]]
* Build example as CJK idioms dictionary bot
** It'll be used as main testing cases and be kept quick and dirty until building the library is done
