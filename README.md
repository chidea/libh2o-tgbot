# libh2o-tgbot
A fast, efficient [Telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) server library based on [libh2o](https://github.com/h2o/h2o)

### Plan
- [x] Going to use webhooks as default request result handler since libh2o is good at this kind of work
- [x] Main structures are going to be based on [[https://github.com/tucnak/telebot|Golang Telebot framework]]
- [x] At first, CJK idioms dictionary bot example will be written in mruby
- [ ] and then converted later to C codes
- [ ] and the library will be built by generalizing it
